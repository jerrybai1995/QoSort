Pastila is a parallel implementation library of (traditionally sequential) HMM algorithms for evaluation and decoding. This simple library will leverage parallel features in CPU (and potentially GPU) offered by multi-core machines and meanwhile re-formulate the problem so that it fits parallel computing.

The authors for this library are, for now, Shaojie Bai and Yutong Chen at CMU.
