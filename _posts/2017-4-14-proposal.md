## Title

QuSort: Optimized Large-Scale Parallel Sorting on CPUs

## Authors

  - Shaojie Bai (shaojieb@andrew.cmu.edu)
  - Yutong Chen (yutongc@andrew.cmu.edu)

## Tech

  - **Programming Languages**: Java, Go
  - **Hardware Tech**: CPU (w/ OpenMP), potentially SIMD

## Summary

This project is inspired by CMU'S [210 Sorting Competition](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/sort.html), where we are to design and implement sorting algorithms that can work well on large-scale datasets (of size ~100M). We will explore two different programming languages (primarily Go, and then Java), along with different sorting methods, to build a simple parallel sorting library.

## Background

The two major factors that this project shall focus on are (1) language differences (GC, in particular); and (2) sorting methods (how parallel is it?)

#### 1. Garbage-Collected Languages

Unlike languages such as C or C++, many languages support garbage collection through mechanisms such as reference counting. Such automatic mechanism signals a tradeoff of development convenience and execution performance--- especially with respect to memory management and computation resources. In this project, we focus on the sorting library in garbage collected language. Our primary language focus will be Golang (which we will use to enter the competition), but we shall also explore the CPU-parallel in Java.
  
#### 2. Sample Sort

One idea that we have in mind is the parallel sample sort. This is similar to quicksort, but the idea is now to randomly pick a few bucket separator. Then, parallel sorting can take place within each bucket. 

#### 3. Quick Sort

Quicksort is a classical sorting method. However, while easy to do this iteratively (and in an embarrassingly parallel way), it is significantly harder to optimize the parallelism within it. Given a huge array of double values, load balance, cache management and sorting method itself will have enormous effect on the performance.


## The Challenge

There are three aspects in this problem that we found interesting:
  - **No existing great parallel sorting library in the language**: The existing sort in Go, for example, is strictly sequential (albeit fast). Therefore, we expect to spend lots of time spotting the parallelism within the algorithm, and meanwhile create a benchmark to compare to.
  - **Most work done on GPU**: We found that many of the peer-evaluated publications have been focusing on GPU-based large-scale sorting. For those that address CPU-based parallel sorting, the authors typically use C or C++--- so they are not very helpful in our case.
  - **Language difference**: Different languages support a different range of parallel framework. For example, Go uses goroutine to auto-parallelize, Java uses Fork/Join pattern, Python uses multiprocessing module, etc. It is up to us to determine the which library or data structure we want to use.
  - **High dependency on sorting method**: Different sorting methods create lots of distinction. Some methods may not be sequential-friendly, but can be great to use in parallel environment (e.g. bitonic sort). Therefore, it is our job to explore different methods and analyze their pros and cons.

## Resources
  
  - **Hardware**: We need multicore (at least 24) machines that (potentially) support SIMD vector programming. **It'd be great if the course staff can help us with this!!**

## Goals

### What do we want to achieve?

#### 1. Speedup

For the competition, Professor Guy Blleloch provided runnable codes in SML and C++ that used **sample sort** method. In particular, the SML code was able to sort a size-100M array in 0.33 second on a 72-core machine and 1.1 seconds on a 20-core machine. The C++ implementation (with essentially the same idea) could achieve the same goal in 0.183 second on a 72-core machine.

Our goal, of course, is to match at least the magnitude of their results. Because we are primarily implementing in other higher-level languages, we expect the performance to be not as good as the program in C++. But in general, we hope to get within 3 seconds for sorting on array of size 100M.

#### 2. Demo Plan (Deliverables)

We expect to demo the comparison graphs, where we shall compare the results across different sorting methods as well as the languages we implement the methods in. Moreover, we will compare our result to the sort methods Go (and Java) currently supports. We expect some great speedup. 
 

## Platform choice

We will develop mainly in Go first (we will focus on this), and then use Java (which supports Fork/Join parallelism by Java's *ExecutorService* interface). 

## Tentative schedule

  - By April 18: Finish the baseline implementation as well as necessary paper reading. Identify benchmark. 
  - By April 20: Develop the first parallel version of quicksort and identify areas of improvement.
  - By April 25: Develop some ideas for further optimizing parallelism on the tasks; start on sample sort. 
  - By April 27: At least finish with one sorting model. Ought to make the sorting interface as generic as possible (e.g. not only limiter to []float64 in Go, etc.).
  - By May 3: Finish at least two sorting models in Go. Be prepared for the competition.
  - By May 9: Two ways to go: either (1) focus on Go and implement more parallel sorting methods; or (2) Implement similar models in Java and make comparisons.
  - By May 10: Have all necessary data collected, and be prepared for the presentation.
